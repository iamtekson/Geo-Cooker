          In today's world, the consumption of supermarket-sourced and processed
          foods has become a widespread habit. Convenience often takes
          precedence over nutrition, leading to a decline in the overall health
          and well-being of individuals. Additionally, the carbon impact of
          transporting food across long distances, commonly referred to as "food
          miles," has emerged as a significant concern for environmental
          sustainability. This ultimately leads to a disconnect between people
          and the origins of their food. It is evident that a transformative
          solution is needed to address these challenges and promote healthier,
          eco-friendly eating habits.

          The problem that we are addressing is our food systems' lack of
          flexibility. Our current food system has proven vulnerable to climate
          change, natural disasters, and disease. Under Covid, many of us found
          that our personal food system was put under distress due to the global
          nature of dependence. However, one of the solutions that came out was
          a stronger local-based food system because it was a location-based
          solution. In being more location-based, strategies for climate
          adaptation, inherent reduction of carbon emissions, and decreased
          waste and inefficiencies.

          We are working on solving the aforementioned problem by encouraging
          local seasonal produce consumption by engaging with the public. We are
          achieving this by taking local seasonal foods and providing access to
          recipes for meals. We are building off of CSA and other forms of local
          food systems (the work that has been done already), by connecting the
          public with a different vantage point for looking at our food system.
          Our application, "Geo-Cooker," intends to serve as this solution by
          allowing users to input their zip code, cross-referencing that
          geographic point with our agricultural and farmer's market data to
          identify local and in-season ingredients. Using an automation tool,
          these ingredients are processed through an online recipe generator,
          "Super Cook," to generate recipes from nearby produce. This
          application focuses on the state of Colorado for now, but can
          hopefully extend its scope if taken beyond the hackathon. Ultimately,
          this app aims to pave the way for a more sustainable and mindful
          approach to food consumption.â€¯The application is going to be map
          focused so people can see what food are coming from where in their
          area.
