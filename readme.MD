# ESRI Hackathon (Geo-Cooker Team)

GeoCooker is an interactive app that allows users to find recipes using seasonal produce from local small-scale farms.

## Abstract

In today's world, the consumption of supermarket-sourced and processed foods has become a widespread habit. Convenience often takes precedence over nutrition, leading to a decline in the overall health and well-being of individuals. Additionally, the carbon impact of transporting food across long distances, commonly referred to as "food miles," has emerged as a significant concern for environmental sustainability. This ultimately leads to a disconnect between people and the origins of their food. It is evident that a transformative solution is needed to address these challenges and promote healthier, eco-friendly eating habits.

The problem that we are addressing is our food systems' lack of flexibility. Our current food system has proven vulnerable to climate change, natural disasters, and disease. Under Covid, many of us found that our personal food system was put under distress due to the global nature of dependence. However, one of the solutions that came out was a stronger local-based food system because it was a location-based solution. In being more location-based, strategies for climate adaptation, inherent reduction of carbon emissions, and decreased waste and inefficiencies.

We are working on solving the aforementioned problem by encouraging local seasonal produce consumption by engaging with the public. We are achieving this by taking local seasonal foods and providing access to recipes for meals. We are building off of CSA and other forms of local food systems (the work that has been done already), by connecting the public with a different vantage point for looking at our food system. Our application, "Geo-Cooker," intends to serve as this solution by allowing users to input their zip code, cross-referencing that geographic point with our agricultural and farmer's market data to identify local and in-season ingredients. Using an automation tool, these ingredients are processed through an online recipe generator, "Super Cook," to generate recipes from nearby produce. This application focuses on the state of Colorado for now, but can hopefully extend its scope if taken beyond the hackathon. Ultimately, this app aims to pave the way for a more sustainable and mindful approach to food consumption.â€¯The application is going to be map focused so people can see what food are coming from where in their area.
